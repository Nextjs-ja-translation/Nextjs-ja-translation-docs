You can get in-depth information about dynamic routes in our documentation:

  </Link>
- <Link href="/docs/[...slug]" as="/docs/routing/dynamic-routes">
    <a>Dynamic Routes</a>
  </Link>

But here is some essential information you should know about dynamic routes.

### Fetch External API or Query Database

Like `getStaticProps`, `getStaticPaths` can fetch data from any data source. In our example, `getAllPostIds` (which is used by `getStaticPaths`) may fetch from an external API endpoint:

```js
export async function getAllPostIds() {
  // Instead of the file system,
  // fetch post data from an external API endpoint
  const res = await fetch('..')
  const posts = await res.json()
  return posts.map(post => {
    return {
      params: {
        id: post.id
      }
    }
  })
}
```

### Development v.s. Production

- In **development** (`npm run dev` or `yarn dev`), `getStaticPaths` runs on _every request_.
- In **production**, `getStaticPaths` runs at _build time_.

### Fallback

Recall that we returned `fallback: false` from `getStaticPaths`. What does this mean?

If `fallback` is `false`, then any paths not returned by `getStaticPaths` will result in a **404 page**.

If `fallback` is `true`, then the behavior of `getStaticProps` changes:

- The paths returned from `getStaticPaths` will be rendered to HTML at build time.
- The paths that have not been generated at build time will **not** result in a 404 page. Instead, Next.js will serve a “fallback” version of the page on the first request to such a path.
- In the background, Next.js will statically generate the requested path. Subsequent requests to the same path will serve the generated page, just like other pages pre-rendered at build time.

This is beyond the scope of our lessons, but you can learn more about `fallback: true` in <Link href="/docs/[...slug]" as="/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#fallback-pages"><a>our documentation</a></Link>.

### Catch-all Routes

Dynamic routes can be extended to catch all paths by adding three dots (`...`) inside the brackets. For example:

- `pages/posts/[...id].js` matches `/posts/a`, but also `/posts/a/b`, `/posts/a/b/c` and so on.

If you do this, in `getStaticPaths`, you must return an array as the value of the `id` key like so:

```js
return [
  {
    params: {
      // Statically Generates /posts/a/b/c
      id: ['a', 'b', 'c']
    }
  }
  //...
]
```

And `params.id` will be an array in `getStaticProps`:

```js
export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  // params.id will be like ['a', 'b', 'c']
}
```

### Router

If you want to access the Next.js router, you can do so by importing the `useRouter` hook from `next/router`. Take a look at our <Link href="/docs/[...slug]" as="/docs/routing/dynamic-routes"><a>router documentation</a></Link> to learn more.

### 404 Pages

To create a custom 404 page, create `pages/404.js`. This file is statically generated at build time.

```jsx
// pages/404.js
export default function Custom404() {
  return <h1>404 - Page Not Found</h1>
}
```

### That’s it!

In the next lesson, we’ll talk about the API Routes feature for Next.js.
