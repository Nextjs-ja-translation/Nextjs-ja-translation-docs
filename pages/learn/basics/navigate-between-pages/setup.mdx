import Layout from '../../../../components/learn/Layout'
import SkipPageButton from '../../../../components/learn/SkipPageButton.js'

export const meta = {
  title: 'Navigate Between Pages',
  courseId: 'basics',
  lessonId: 'navigate-between-pages',
  stepId: 'setup'
}

**If you’re continuing from the previous lesson,** you can skip this page. Click the button below to go to the next page.

<SkipPageButton meta={meta} />

### Download Starter Code (Optional)

If you’re NOT continuing from the previous lesson, you can download, install, and run the starter code for this lesson below. This sets up a `nextjs-blog` directory such that it’s identical to the result of the previous lesson.

Again, this is NOT necessary if you’ve just finished the previous lesson.

```shell
npm init next-app nextjs-blog --example "https://github.com/zeit/next-learn-starter/tree/master/navigate-between-pages-starter"
```

Then follow the instructions from the command output (`cd` into the directory and start the development server).

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
