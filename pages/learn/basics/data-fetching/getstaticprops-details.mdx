You can get in-depth information about `getStaticProps` in <Link href="/docs/[...slug]" as="/docs/basic-features/data-fetching"><a>our documentation</a></Link>. But here is some essential information you should know about `getStaticProps`.

### Fetch External API or Query Database

In our `lib/posts.js`, we’ve implemented `getSortedPostsData` which fetches data from the file system. But you can fetch the data from other sources, like an external API endpoint, and it’ll work just fine:

```js
import fetch from 'node-fetch'

export async function getSortedPostsData() {
  // Instead of the file system,
  // fetch post data from an external API endpoint
  const res = await fetch('..')
  return res.json()
}
```

You can also query the database directly:

```js
import someDatabaseSDK from 'someDatabaseSDK'

const databaseClient = someDatabaseSDK.createClient(...)

export async function getSortedPostsData() {
  // Instead of the file system,
  // fetch post data from a database
  return databaseClient.query('SELECT posts...')
}
```

This is possible because `getStaticProps` runs **only on the server-side**. It will never be run on the client-side. It won’t even be included in the JS bundle for the browser. That means you can write code such as direct database queries without them being sent to browsers.

### Development vs. Production

- In **development** (`npm run dev` or `yarn dev`), `getStaticProps` runs on _every request_.
- In **production**, `getStaticProps` runs at _build time_.

Because it’s meant to be run at build time, you won’t be able to use data that’s only available during request time, such as query parameters or HTTP headers.

### Only Allowed in a Page

`getStaticProps` can only be exported from a **page**. You can’t export it from non-page files.

One of the reasons for this restriction is that React needs to have all the required data before the page is rendered.

### What If I Need to Fetch Data at Request Time?

Static Generation is **not** a good idea if you cannot pre-render a page ahead of a user's request. Maybe your page shows frequently updated data, and the page content changes on every request.

In cases like this, you can try **Server-side Rendering** or skipping pre-rendering. Let’s talk about these strategies before we move on to the next lesson.
