Before we talk about data fetching, let’s talk about one of the most important concepts in Next.js: **Pre-rendering**.

By default, Next.js pre-renders every page. This means that Next.js _generates HTML for each page in advance_, instead of having it all done by client-side JavaScript. Pre-rendering can result in better performance and SEO.

Each generated HTML is associated with minimal JavaScript code necessary for that page. When a page is loaded by the browser, its JavaScript code runs and makes the page fully interactive. (This process is called **hydration**.)

### Check That Pre-rendering Is Happening

You can check that pre-rendering is happening by taking the following steps:

- Disable JavaScript in your browser (here’s how in [Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript/disable)) and…
- [Try accessing this page](https://next-learn-starter.now.sh/) (the final result of this tutorial).

You should see that your app is rendered without JavaScript. That’s because Next.js has pre-rendered the app into static HTML, allowing you to see the app UI without running JavaScript.

> **Note**: You can also try the above steps on `localhost`, but CSS won’t be loaded if you disable JavaScript.

If your app is a plain React.js app (without Next.js), there’s no pre-rendering, so you won’t be able to see the app if you disable JavaScript. For example:

- Enable JavaScript in your browser and [check out this page](https://create-react-app.now-examples.now.sh/). This is a plain React.js app built with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).
- Now, disable JavaScript and access [the same page](https://create-react-app.now-examples.now.sh/) again.
- You won’t see the app anymore — instead, it’ll say “You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.” This is because the app is not pre-rendered into static HTML.

### Summary: Pre-rendering vs No Pre-rendering

Here’s a quick graphical summary:

<Image
  shadow
  alt="Pre-rendering"
  oversize={false}
  src="/static/images/learn/data-fetching/pre-rendering.png"
  width={1386 / 2}
  height={824 / 2}
/>
<Image
  shadow
  alt="No pre-rendering"
  oversize={false}
  src="/static/images/learn/data-fetching/no-pre-rendering.png"
  width={1386 / 2}
  height={688 / 2}
/>

Next, let’s talk about **two forms** of pre-rendering in Next.js.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
