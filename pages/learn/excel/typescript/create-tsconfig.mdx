export const meta = {
  title: 'TypeScript',

  lessonId: 'typescript',
  stepId: 'create-tsconfig',
  subtitle: 'Create tsconfig.json'
}

To get started, create an **empty** `tsconfig.json` file in the root of your project:

```shell
touch tsconfig.json
```

Now, try **starting/restarting** the development server (`npm run dev` or `yarn dev`). It will give you a warning that says something like below:

> It looks like you're trying to use TypeScript but do not have the required package(s) installed.

Follow the instructions to install TypeScript:

```bash
# If you’re using npm
npm install --save-dev typescript @types/react @types/node

# If you’re using Yarn
yarn add --dev typescript @types/react @types/node
```

Now, try **starting** the development server again. After starting the server, Next.js will:

- Populate the `tsconfig.json` file for you. You may customize this file.
- Create the `next-env.d.ts` file, which ensures Next.js types are picked up by the TypeScript compiler. You should **not** touch this file.

You can now use TypeScript for your Next.js app. Let’s talk about how to convert your Next.js app into TypeScript.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
