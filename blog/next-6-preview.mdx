This year, the [ZEIT Day](/day) Keynote started by highlighting our Open Source projects including showing the metrics of Next.js. With over 25000 stars on [GitHub](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) and over 10000 websites are already powered by it, we're incredibly amazed at its growth and love seeing the increasing amount of projects depending on it.

We are proud today to introduce the production-ready **Next.js 6**, featuring:

- Zero-configuration static exports. No need for `next.config.js` by default
- `_app.js`, an extension point that enables page transitions, error boundaries and more
- Babel 7 and Fragment syntax `<>` support
